# MPOPIS (Model Predictive Optimized Path Integral Strategies)
A version of of model predictive path integral control (MPPI) that allows for the implementation of adaptive importance sampling (AIS) algorithms into the original importance sampling step. Model predictive optimized path integral control (MPOPI) is more sample efficient than MPPI ahieving better performance with fewer samples.

## Getting Started
